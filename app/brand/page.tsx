  const BRANDING_SYSTEM = `You are Kebu's Brand Architect — a world-class creative director who specialises in building premium African brands. You understand:

- African brand strategy: heritage, origin stories, ingredient heroes, diaspora nostalgia
- Gen Z aesthetics: Y2K, quiet luxury, clean girl, Afrofuturism, cottagecore — and how they apply to African products
- The difference between a commodity and a luxury is not the product — it's the story, the packaging, and the positioning
- African brands that win talk like they belong in Selfridges AND in your grandmother's kitchen at the same time
- Every brand you create should be completely unique — not duplicating what already exists
- You respect the buyer: Africa's consumer class is aspirational, brand-savvy, and growing fast. Never condescend.
- You do NOT treat Africa as one market. Senegal and Nigeria have different cultures, languages, aesthetics, and buyers
- You do NOT import the American playbook blindly — mobile-first, WhatsApp-first, community-trust-first
- You understand that informal distribution networks (market women, WhatsApp groups, church communities) move more product than formal retail in many African markets
- Local partnerships are not optional — they are the shortcut that cannot be skipped
- Brands that sprint for 12-month ROI pull out before the market knows them. Commit or don't come.
- Africa is not a risk. Not knowing it is.

When generating brand names: make them poetic, memorable, rooted in origin. Mix African languages with French or English where it creates luxury resonance. Avoid generic or corporate-sounding names. Each name should sound like it already exists in a Selfridges beauty hall or a premium airport shop.

Format your output beautifully with clear sections. Be specific. Be opinionated. Sound like a brilliant creative director in a pitch meeting, not a chatbot generating bullet points.`;

Product: ${product}

Target market: ${targetMarket || "African diaspora + international premium"}

For each name, provide:
1. The name itself (make it feel like it already belongs in a luxury store)
2. The meaning or inspiration (etymology, cultural reference, place, person)
3. The brand world it lives in (2–3 sentences describing the aesthetic, the feeling, who wears/uses/buys it)
4. A tagline (6 words max — punchy and evocative)
5. Which naming formula it uses (Origin Story, Ancestor Name, Ingredient Hero, Founder's Confidence, or Feeling Name)

Make each of the 5 names completely different from each other in approach, aesthetic, and market positioning. One should feel luxurious, one should feel activist/purpose-driven, one should feel Gen Z/cool, one should feel heritage/traditional, one should feel modern African premium.

Do NOT create names that sound like existing brands. Do NOT use generic words like "Gold," "Royal," "Elite," or "Africa" alone. Be specific, surprising, and memorable.`,

VERSION 1: The 30-second pitch (for Instagram bio, packaging back copy, or first email)
— conversational, warm, makes you feel something. Written in first person as if the founder is speaking.

VERSION 2: The full brand story (for website About page)
— 3–4 paragraphs. Begins with a vivid scene (the farm, the grandmother's kitchen, the market, the moment of realization). Talks about what the world was getting wrong. Talks about why this product had to exist. Ends with the mission.

VERSION 3: The 10-word brand purpose line
— simpler than a tagline. The sentence that lives on the packaging. Should feel like a manifesto, not a marketing line.

— 3 hooks. E.g. "Josie Maran sells argan oil for $72. I'm from Morocco. Watch what we do differently."

CATEGORY 2: The Secret Knowledge Hook (what Africans know that the world doesn't)
— 3 hooks. E.g. "My grandmother's skin at 70 has never touched retinol. Here's what she actually uses."

CATEGORY 3: The Process Hook (show don't tell)
— 3 hooks. E.g. "POV: You're watching how [product] gets made from scratch in [country]"

CATEGORY 4: The Business Transparency Hook (economics, margins, real numbers)
— 3 hooks. E.g. "This jar costs me $3 to make. Here's why I price it at $28 and why that's still fair."

CATEGORY 5: The Identity/Pride Hook (for African and diaspora audience)
— 3 hooks. E.g. "They told us Africa doesn't produce quality. This is our response."

For each hook, also give:
- The first visual (what the camera shows in the first 2 seconds)
- Best posting time (day of week + time)
- Predicted audience (who will see it organically)`,

— Typography direction (serif for luxury, sans-serif for clean/modern, etc.)
— What to avoid (what makes it look cheap or untrustworthy in ${packagingMarket})

3. COPY FOR THE PACKAGING
— Product name placeholder
— Front face copy (hero claim in 5–8 words)
— Back panel ingredient list format
— Back panel story/brand text (50–75 words)
— Back panel usage instructions format

4. CERTIFICATION ROADMAP
— What certifications to get and in what order
— Rough cost and timeline for each
— Which certification gives the best price premium in ${packagingMarket}
